                        reSEEt was developed as a project for Stanford's TreeHacks in February 2019. Our team wanted to
                        target the student population and other populations which
                        split receipts between groups of people. The idea was to have an app which would scan receipts,
                        use computer vision software to identify what was on the receipt, and
                        then allow members to claim shares of items. This would be an app which would integrate into
                        money requesting apps such as Venmo, Square Cash, and PayPal.

                        We used Google's Firebase as our database for storing data, and their ml-kit for analyzing the
                        images.
                        We were all new to mobile app development, and so began research into what Apple and Google
                        (Android) had to offer, eventually settling on creating an iOS app.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We immediately ran into many challenges with scanning receipts. The first was image quality, and
                        the second was the format of receipts.

                        In order to use the text-recognition service offered by Google, we first needed to take quality
                        images or preprocess images for easier text recognition.

                        To address the issue of receipt format, we ultimately decided upon using a ML caterization
                        system which would first detect the type of receipt being scanned and the format associated with
                        the receipt. We could then parse the data
                        and throw out unnecessary paramters in the receipt such as item ID, and keep necessary pieces of
                        information, such as the item name and price.

                        <br>
                        <br>

                        Our team ultimately spent a large portion of our time learning how to use the libraries and
                        protocols that Firebase ML and Swift had to offer. We developed a simple version of the app and
                        demoed it. Unfortunately, our team did not take home
                        any prizes, though the experience was a blast.

                        <br><br>
                        Here's a simplified transcript of one of our conversations concerning the output of the ML scan
                        of the image from Firebase's ml-kit text detection,
                        and how we would allow a user to click on a price on the receipt to add person to split it with:
                    <blockquote>
                        The only data available is the string [detected] itself and the coordinate of that specific
                        string.
                        [The] same characters have the exact description name within the file and location and
                        arrangements of the order of the strings are random.
                        <br>
                        We need code that processes a touch and have an inbound range [area of detection so that the tap
                        doesn't need to be too precise] of the pixel count that selects the value we want.
                        The values [pixel values for clicking on the screen] should be a premade list that list out the
                        money values in sequence as the receipt shows.
                        The new pixel value of the created string, ex. 1.89 should have the coordinate of the average
                        coordinate of the characters that make up that string.
                        The premade list may have to be a hashmap.
                    </blockquote>
